Nara-Bot
========

An Arduino controlled Robot.

These sketches are designed for an Arduino Mega 2560, and an Arduino UNO. They use libraries
from the Adafruit motorshield, qik motor shield, and NewPing.

Processing uses Procontroll.

Sketches have been tested on Windows 7 x64, and OS X 10.7.3+. As always though, YMMV.
